Any special instructions for grading (it should be easy for someone to run your app from a new machine):
None. The application installs with “npm install”, loads cleanly using “node loadDatabase.js”, and runs using “node webServer.js” with no additional setup required. 
May need to use "npm run build" to load frontend items in some cases.
